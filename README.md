# Architect

This project is an example of using [fabricant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fabricant) with [THREE](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three). It uses a Unity3D-like architecture to instantiate scene node objects with components as defined in their prefabs.

Read more about [Unity's prefabs](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) to understand the aims of fabricant.
